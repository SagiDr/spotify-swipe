## Swipe Mode

Discover new music through an intuitive swipe interface.

1. Connect your Spotify account
2. Choose your language and number of songs
3. Swipe right to like, left to skip
4. Get a custom playlist saved directly to your Spotify library

Songs are curated from a wide range of genres and artists, filtered by popularity with a maximum of one track per artist and per album to keep things fresh.

## Trivia Mode

Think you know your playlists? Put it to the test.

1. Pick any playlist from your Spotify library
2. Listen to short audio clips from tracks in that playlist
3. Guess the song from four multiple-choice options
4. See your final score and play again with a different playlist

The trivia game pulls tracks directly from your playlists, so every round is personal and different.
